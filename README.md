# Tetris Clone

Function oriented hack version of tetris in vanilla Javasctipt.
I looked at a few different implementations and found some techniques I liked and then added my own ideas.

This is just a proof of concept. I would like to create a full clone of the game, including more "bullpen" pieces (the original game shows NEXT plus 3 future), and the ability to "hold" a piece. The best way to get this done is to split up the code and make it more object oriented. Tetrominos should be objects that the gamearena can spawn.

I wouls also like to improve the scoring (to match the originial) and create an API that connects to a database of high scores.
